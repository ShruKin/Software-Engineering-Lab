    The Indian Super League (ISL) is a professional football league which represents the sport's highest level in the Indian football league system. It is organized by the All India Football Federation and their commercial partners Football Sports Development. The league comprises 11 clubs with each season generally running from November to March. During the league stage of the competition, each club will play 20 games against the others in a round-robin style. The top four clubs at the end of the league stage will qualify for the play-offs. The season will then culminate with the ISL Final to determine the champion. The league has been officially known as the Hero Indian Super League since its inception, due to a sponsorship agreement with Hero MotoCorp.

    The competition was founded on 21 October 2013 with the goal of growing the sport of football in India and increasing its exposure in the country. The league began in October 2014 with eight teams. During its first three seasons, the competition operated without official recognition from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), the governing body for the sport in Asia. The competition was also structured along the same lines as the Indian Premier League, the country's premier Twenty20 cricket competition. Each season lasted just 3 months, from October to December, and matches were held daily. However, prior to the 2017â€“18 season, the league expanded to ten teams, expanded its schedule to six months, and earned recognition from the AFC.
